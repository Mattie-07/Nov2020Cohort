When setting up the ReactDOM, remember to use exact for any path that has similar roots. 
    in order for a user to get to the page / when there is another page with the route /something
    the one with just the / would have to have the keyword 'exact'
 
    Just like in JS, in react the Swtich tag is looking for the route that matches the one that the user is trying to get to. 
    Children is a built in keyword
    
    className is what you would use in React while just regular class is used in JS
    import './assets/styles.css' has access everywhere, with all the children because its at the root.
    in class based components you use this.setState that takes in an object. 

    In the very beginnning, the state that is in the constructor is what is going to get changed by all of the methods that I create later on

could you use a useeffect if you dont have a dependecny list?

You wouldnt have to use Use Effect in the exomple with did earlier because
