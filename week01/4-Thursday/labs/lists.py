# and changes them to lowercase .

# 4. Add Pluto to the planet list.

# Find how many cities are listed in the Houston list
# Add more cities to the Houston list.
# Print the list cities (one city per line)

# 6. Since Pluto isn't really a planet, delete it from the planet list


# 7. Create the following lists that are a subset of the Houston list:
# htx1 = The first 4 cities
# htx2 = Cities 3-6
# htx3 = The last 2 cities

# 7. Insert Denver in the Houston list after The Heights

# 8.  Remove the last city from the Houston List

# 9. Get the index of Seabrook from the Houston list

# 10. Sort the list of cities

# 11. Copy the Houston list to a list called USCities

# 12. Remove all items from the Houston list

# 13. Take the following list and multiply 5 times

# nums = [4, 5, 7, 8]

# 14


# 15. Reverse the String "DigitalCrafts"


# 16.  Crete a range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# 17. Create a range [6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
