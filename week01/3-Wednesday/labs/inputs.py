# Please enter your name: Eric
# Hello, Eric!
name = input("Please enter your name\n")
print(f"Hello {name}!")

# Prompt the user for his name using the input function. Example:


# Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's
# name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name.

print(f"Hello {name.upper()}!")
print(f"The number of letters in your name is {len(name)}")
# (Hint: You'll want to search for documentation on how to uppercase a string.)
