    after creating all of the files above the next thing you would need to do is make sure all the pg stuff is installed ( which it is) 
    Then you would create the database, by going config.json and making sure all of the correct information is there.
    Once that is done, in the root folder , type ' sequelize db:create'

    Ok now to the next step, which is making the tables and declaring the columns.
        create a file called setup.bash in the root
        in there create "sequelize model:generate --name roles --attributes name:string,roleType:integer"
        or something similar to that.
            Whenever I am finished with this the keyword I would need to implement the code is :
                bash setup.bash

    **this also creates the migration! and the models as well!!**
    Go to the migrations page and 
        

        ROLES NEEDS TO BE FIRST! DELETE USERS AND DO AGAIN

        sequelize seed:generate --


When the user 'posts" that is adding information to the database. 
everytime we deal with the deatabase it is going to be an asnychornous call.
Seems as if the middleware items are always put in the js files.
